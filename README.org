* bglproject 

** Description
   A simple project creation tool for bigloo. It generates starting projects for binary and library packages.

** Usage 
  Create a starting library package with:  

  #+begin_src shell
  bglproject_s create <project-name> 
#+end_src

  Create a starting binary package with:

    #+begin_src shell
  bglproject_s create <project-name> -bin 
#+end_src

  By default, the author's name is take from the =USER= environment variable but it can be set explicitly with:

      #+begin_src shell
  bglproject_s create <project-name> -bin --author <authors name> 
#+end_src
  

** Building
  Both the bigloo native and jvm backends are supported. To build,
  execute:
    #+begin_src shell
  ./configure --prefix=<installation path prefix>; make
#+end_src
  where =<installation path prefix>= is the desired installation path
  prefix (e.g, =/usr/local=). You usually want the path prefix to match
  that used for Bigloo itself.

** Installation
  To install the library, execute:
#+begin_src shell
  make install
#+end_src
